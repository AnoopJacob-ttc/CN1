<h3>MESSAGE DELIVERY OPTIONS</h3>
Network communications has similar delivery options to communicate. There three types of data communications include:
<ul>
<li><b>Unicast</b> - Information is being transmitted to a single end device</li>
<li><b>Multicast</b> - Information is being transmitted to a one or more end devices.</li>
<li><b>Broadcast</b> - Information is being transmitted to all end devices.</li></ul>

<h3>THE BENEFITS OF USING A LAYERED MODELS</h3>
<p>You cannot actually watch real packets travel across a real network, the way you can watch the components of a car being put together on an assembly line. so, it helps to have a way of thinking about a network so that you can imagine what is happening. A model is useful in these situations.</p>
<p>Complex concepts such as how a network operates can be difficult to explain and understand. For this reason, a layered model is used to modularze the operations of a network into manageable layers.</p>
<p>These are the benefits of using a layered model to describe network protocols and operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assisting in protocol design because protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a defined interface to the layers above and below</li>
<li>Fostering competition because products from different vendors can work together</li>
<li>Preventing technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers above and below</li>
<li>Providing a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two layered models that are used to describe network operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model</li>
<li>TCP/IP Reference Model</li>
</ul>

<h3>THE OSI REFERENCE MODEL</h3>
<p>The OSI reference model provides an extensive list of functions and services that can occur at each layer. This type of model provides consistency within all types of network protocols and services by describing what must be done at a particular layer, but not prescribing how it should be accomplished.</p>
<p>It also describes the interaction of each layer with the layers directly above and below. The TCP/IP protocols discussed in this course are structured around both the OSI and TCP/IP models. The table shows details about each layer of the OSI model. The functionality of each layer and the relationship between layers will become more evident throughout this course as the protocols are discussed in more detail.</p>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

<h3>THE TCP/IP PROTOCOL MODEL</h3>
<p>The TCP/IP protocol model for internetwork communications was created in the early 1970s and is sometimes referred to as the internet model This type of model closely matches the structure of a particular protocol suite. The TCP/IP model is a protocol model because it describes the functions that occur at each layer of protocols within the TCP/IP suite. TCP/IP is also used as a reference model. The table shows details about each layer of the TCP/IP model.</p>

    <table class="addressing-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>OSI MODEL LAYER</th>
                <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><b>4- Application</b></td>
                <td>Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>3 - Transport</b></td>
                <td>Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>2 - Internet</b></td>
                <td>Determines the best path through the network</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>1 - Network Access</b></td>
                <td>Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
    </table>

<h3>OSI and TCP/IP Model Comparison</h3>
<p>The protocols that make up the TCP/IP protocol suite can also be described in terms of the OSI reference model. In the OSI model, the network access layer and the application layer of the TCP/IP model are further divided to describe discrete functions that must occur at these layers</p>
<p>At the network access layer, the TCP/IP protocol suite does not specify which protocols to use when transmitting over a physical medium; it only describes the handoff from the internet layer to the physical network protocols. OSI Layers 1 and 2 discuss the necessary procedures to access the media and the physical means to send data over a network.</p>

<h3>PROTOCOL DATA UNITS</h3>
<p>As application data is passed down the protocol stack on its way to be transmitted across the network media, various protocol information is added at each level. This is known as the encapsulation process.</p>
<p>Note: Although the UDP PDU is called datagram, IP packets are sometimes also referred to as IP datagrams.</p>
<p>The form that a piece of data takes at any layer is called a protocol data unit (PDU). During encapsulation, each succeeding layer encapsulates the PDU that it receives from the layer above in accordance with the protocol being used. At each stage of the process, a PDU has a different name to reflect its new functions. Although there is no universal naming convention for PDUs, in this course, the PDUs are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite. The PDUs for each form of data are shown in the figure</p>

<p><b>Data</b> - The general term for the PDU used at therapplication layer</p>
<ul><li><b>Segment</b> - Transport layer PDU</li>
<li><b>Packet</b> - Network layer PDU</li>
<li><b>Frame</b> - Data Link layer PDU</li>
<li><b>Bits</b>- Physical layer PDU used when physically transmitting data over the medium</li></ul>
<p>Note: If the Transport header is TCP, then it is a <b>segment</b>. If the Transport header is UDP then it is a <b>datagram.</b></p>
