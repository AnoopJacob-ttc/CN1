<p>A network is a group of computers and devices connected together to share information and resources like files, printers, and internet connections.</p>

<h3>WHY NETWORKING IS IMPORTANT</h3>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">Sharing Resources:</span> Multiple computers can share printers, storage, and internet.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Communication:</span> People can send emails, chat, or make video calls easily.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Cost Efficiency:</span> Sharing resources reduces cost for businesses.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Centralized Data:</span> Data can be stored on one computer (server) and accessed by others.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Remote Access:</span> Employees can access company systems from anywhere.</li>
</ul>

<h3>COMMON TYPES OF NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
<h4>LAN</h4>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">A LAN (Local Area Network) connects devices within a small geographic area such as a home, office, or school.</li>
    <li><span class="important">It allows devices to share resources like files, printers, and internet connections.</li>
    <li><span class="important">LANs provide fast and reliable communication between connected devices.</li>
    <li><span class="important">LAN is usually owned and managed by a single organization or person.</li>
    <li><span class="important">It offers higher data transfer speeds compared to WAN networks.</li>
    <li><span class="important">LANs are commonly used in homes, schools, and offices for internal communication.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h4>WAN</h4>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">A WAN (Wide Area Network) connects devices over a large geographic area, such as cities, countries, or even continents.</li>
    <li><span class="important">It allows different LANs to communicate and share resources with each other.</li>
    <li><span class="important">WANs are slower than LANs because they cover longer distances.</li>
    <li><span class="important">They are usually managed by multiple organizations or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</li>
    <li><span class="important">The Internet is the largest example of a WAN.</li>
    <li><span class="important">WANs are commonly used by businesses, governments, and global organizations for long-distance communication.</li>
</ul>

<h3>COMPONENTS OF A NETWORK</h3>
<h4>1. Devices</h4>
<p>Network devices are the hardware used to connect, manage, and control communication between computers and other devices in a network.</p>
<h5>End Devices</h5>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">End devices are the devices at the end of the network where messages are originated and received.</li>
    <li><span class="important">End devices connect to the network through switches or Wi-Fi to communicate with other devices.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Examples: Desktop, Laptop, Server, tablet, IP phone, printer, TVs, CCTV</li>
</ul>
<div class="topology-img">
    <img src="../Images/Theory1.1(3).png" alt="Theory 1.1 Image">
</div>
<h5>Intermediary Devices</h5>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">Intermediary devices are network devices that connect end devices and help move data across the network.</li>
    <li><span class="important">They ensure data reaches the correct destination and maintain efficient network communication.</li>
    <li><span class="important">They forward, filter, or manage data but do not originate or consume it like end devices.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Examples: routers, switches, hubs, and access points.</li>
</ul>
<div class="topology-img">
    <img src="../Images/Theory1.1(4).png" alt="Theory 1.1 Image">
</div>

<h4>2. Medium</h4>
<p>The medium is the physical path or communication channel through which data travels between network devices.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">Metal wires within cables - Data is encoded into electrical impulses.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) - Data is encoded into pulses of light.</li>
    <li><span class="important">Wireless transmission - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.</li>
</ul>
<div class="topology-img">
    <img src="../Images/Theory1.1(5).png" alt="Theory 1.1 Image">
</div>

<h4>3. Protocols</h4>
<p>Protocols are rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. They ensure proper communication between devices.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol):</span> The basic protocol for the internet. TCP ensures reliable data delivery, IP handles addressing.</li>
    <li><span class="important">HTTP / HTTPS:</span> Protocols for accessing web pages securely on the internet.</li>
    <li><span class="important">FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</span> Used to transfer files between computers on a network.</li>
    <li><span class="important">SMTP / POP3 / IMAP:</span> Protocols for sending and receiving emails.</li>
    <li><span class="important">DNS (Domain Name System):</span> Converts website names into IP addresses.</li>
    <li><span class="important">DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):</span> Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.</li>
    <li><span class="important">ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):</span> Used for network diagnostics like ping.</li>
    <li><span class="important">SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):</span> Helps manage and monitor network devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>These three components—<strong>Devices, Medium, and Protocols</strong>—together form the foundation of any computer network, enabling communication, resource sharing, and connectivity in both small and large networks.</p>

<h3>INTERNET</h3>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">The Internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (an internetwork or network of networks).</li>
    <li><span class="important">It allows users to share information and communicate globally.</li>
    <li><span class="important">The Internet uses standard protocols like TCP/IP to transfer data between devices.</li>
    <li><span class="important">It provides services such as websites, email, video streaming, and cloud applications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>INTANET & EXTRANET</h3>
<p>There are two other terms which are similar to the term internet: intranet and extranet.</p>
<p>Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization. An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.</p>
<p>An organization may use an extranet to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization's data. Here are some examples of extranets:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="important">A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors</li>
    <li><span class="important">A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors so they can make appointments for their patients</li>
    <li><span class="important">A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel information to the schools in its district</li>
</ul>
